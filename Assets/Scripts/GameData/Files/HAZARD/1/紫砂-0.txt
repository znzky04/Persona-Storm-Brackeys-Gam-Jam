"What is the meaning of life?
Is it thrill seeking? Chasing fame and fortune?
Maybe life itself has no meaning, at least I can't find it.
Sometimes, I see people around me getting happy step by step.
I felt genuinely anxious, but at the same time I wasn't interested in anything.
Instead of rotting away like this,
I'd rather have something to stimulate myself"

This afternoon, a woman got into a fight with a couple over a parking space.
CCTV footage showed the woman attacking the couple several times with a knife, after both were seriously injured.
The woman fled in the car and the couple were not fatally injured, but police are still investigating the incident and believe the killer will be found soon
